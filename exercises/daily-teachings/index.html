    <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
    static- default - only time you need this is if you were using a framework that was using a different position and you want to change it back to the default. 
    
    
    relative- to their normal position. this means that if we dont give them top, bottom, left and right properties that
    literally nothing will change. 
    
    fixed-Fixed elements are identical to absolute, except that rather than positioning in relation to the positioned 
    ancestor they just stay on the viewport (screen or window) where you put them no matter where you scroll.

    absolute- will position your element in relation to the window. this means that as soon as you change its position to absolute,
    all of the other elements will take its place. (basically removing it from the group.)
        3 positions options for top, bottom, left, right property
