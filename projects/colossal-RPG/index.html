<!-- Project Requirements:
Console must greet player with a fun message
Console must ask for the player's name and store it
Walking:
The console will ask the user to enter a "w" to walk
Every time the player walks, a random algorithm will be run that determines if a wild enemy has appeared (A 1/3 or 1/4 chance of being attacked)
If a wild enemy appears:
The enemy is random (can be chosen out of a minimum of 3 different enemy names)
The user can decide to attack or run
If attacking, you will choose a random attack power between a min and max
If running, you will choose a random number between 1 and 2 - meaning a 50% chance of escaping
After the player attacks or runs the enemy attacks back for a random damage amount
If the player kills the enemy you can give the Player some HP and a special item that is stored in the inventory
If the enemy kills the player the console prints an cool death message and the game ends
Inventory
When the player kills enemies, they are awarded with items
If the user enters 'Print' in the console, the console will print the players name, HP, and each item in their inventory -->
