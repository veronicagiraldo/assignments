# Front End Coding Assessment

It’s worth mentioning that we care about testing our code here at Podium, and it would be beneficial for you to demonstrate how you test in the challenge as well.

Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn’t have the chops to finish out the UI. That’s where you come in, your task is to build a client side app for Shakespeare’s API. The **design** of the application is up to you.
**Endpoints:**
